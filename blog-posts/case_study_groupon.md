# Case Study: Groupon Started as a WordPress Blog

**The Problem**

Andrew Mason's previous startup, "The Point," wasn't working. It was a platform for collective action—people could organize around causes using group influence. Users liked one thing: saving money through group buying power.

**The Pivot**

In 2008, Mason pivoted to focus entirely on group discounts. Instead of building a complex platform, he started with the simplest possible test.

**The MVP**

The first version of Groupon was:
- A basic WordPress blog
- Manual daily posts about deals
- PDFs emailed to subscribers with discount codes
- No payment processing, no automation, nothing fancy

When they launched, they had 500 people on their email list (friends, family, and anyone they could recruit). The first deal? Two-for-one pizza at a restaurant on the ground floor of their Chicago office.

Twenty people bought it.

**How It Actually Worked**

Every day, the team would:
1. Find a local business willing to offer a group discount
2. Write a blog post about the deal
3. Email a PDF to their list
4. Manually track who signed up
5. Send another PDF with the actual coupon if enough people bought

If you wanted a different size or color of a product, you had to email them. They had no forms, no database, no sophisticated infrastructure.

It was, in Mason's words, "totally ghetto."

**Why This Worked**

They were testing one hypothesis: do people want group discounts on local experiences?

They didn't need to prove they could build software. They needed to prove people wanted what they were selling. A WordPress blog was enough for that.

**The Growth**

The model worked. People loved getting deals. Local businesses saw new customers. Word spread.

Once they validated demand:
- They built proper voucher systems
- Created a real backend for processing
- Expanded to other cities
- Scaled the sales team

By 2011, Groupon was called "the fastest-growing company ever," going from launch to billions in valuation in just three years.

**What Went Wrong**

Groupon's story has a twist. After their IPO at $20/share, the stock dropped to $5. They focused too heavily on acquiring new customers instead of retaining existing ones. Their growth was unsustainable.

But that's a scaling problem, not an MVP problem. The MVP itself was brilliantly executed.

**The Lesson**

Your MVP can be embarrassingly simple. WordPress blogs and PDF emails aren't sexy, but they validated a multi-billion dollar market opportunity.

Groupon could have spent months building marketplace software with payment processing, merchant dashboards, and customer accounts. Instead, they spent a weekend setting up a blog and made their first sales immediately.

**Key Takeaway**

Manual processes are a feature of good MVPs, not a bug. If you can deliver value through human effort, do it. Automate only after you've proven people want what you're offering.

Groupon's early version would have failed any code review, but it succeeded where it mattered: proving market demand.
