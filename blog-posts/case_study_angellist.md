# Case Study: AngelList Started With Email Introductions

**The Problem**

Naval Ravikant and Babak Nivi saw a mismatch in startup fundraising. Founders struggled to find the right investors, and angel investors struggled to find quality deal flow. The traditional fundraising process was opaque and inefficient.

**The MVP**

In January 2010, instead of building a platform, they did something absurdly manual:

They made email introductions.

That's it. Using their personal networks, they:
- Connected founders they knew to investors they trusted
- Sent personalized intro emails
- Facilitated conversations manually

No website. No database. No automation. Just email.

**What They Learned**

This manual process taught them critical insights:
- Founders desperately needed better access to investors
- Investors wanted vetted, quality deal flow
- The introduction was valuable, but the format needed work
- Both sides trusted their curation

After seeing strong demand from both founders and investors, they knew they had something worth building.

**Building the Platform**

Only after validating demand did they create AngelList as we know it:
- Profile pages for startups
- Investment opportunities listed publicly
- Accredited investor verification
- Syndicate features for co-investing

But they started with just manual emails to test if anyone cared.

**Why This Approach Worked**

Most founders would have built:
- A marketplace platform
- Payment processing
- Complex matching algorithms
- Legal infrastructure

Ravikant and Nivi tested the core value proposition first: "Will making quality introductions between founders and investors solve a real problem?"

The manual process proved the answer was yes. Everything else was just execution.

**The Concierge Approach**

This is called a "Concierge MVP"—you manually deliver the service that you'll eventually automate. It:
- Tests demand without building infrastructure
- Teaches you exactly what users need
- Validates willingness to engage (even without perfect UX)

AngelList's manual email intros were the perfect concierge MVP for a fundraising platform.

**The Growth**

After proving the concept:
- AngelList became the default platform for startup fundraising
- Added job boards for startup hiring
- Created syndicates for group investing
- Launched Rolling Funds for ongoing investment vehicles

The platform now facilitates billions in startup funding annually.

**The Lesson**

If your product can be delivered manually, deliver it manually first. Don't automate until you've proven people want what you're offering.

AngelList could have spent months building a platform that nobody used. Instead, they sent emails for a few weeks and learned exactly what the market needed.

**Key Takeaway**

Your MVP doesn't need to scale. It just needs to validate demand.

AngelList's email introductions weren't scalable—they'd drown trying to manually connect thousands of founders and investors. But that's okay. Scale is a problem you solve after you've proven the concept.

Start manual. Automate later.
