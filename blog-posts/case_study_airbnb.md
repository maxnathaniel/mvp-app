# Case Study: How Airbnb Started With Air Mattresses and $0

**The Problem**

In 2007, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia had just moved to San Francisco and couldn't afford their rent. A design conference was coming to town, and every hotel was fully booked. Two problems, one opportunity.

**The MVP**

Instead of building a platform, they did something absurdly simple: they took photos of their own apartment, put three air mattresses on the floor, and created a basic webpage called "Air Bed & Breakfast."

They offered:
- A place to sleep on an air mattress
- Breakfast in the morning
- The chance to network with fellow designers

Three people booked. They made enough money to cover rent.

**What Made It Work**

Chesky and Gebbia weren't testing whether they could build a marketplace platform. They were testing a fundamental question: would strangers pay to stay in someone else's home?

The answer was yes. That single insight was worth more than any feature they could have built.

**How They Scaled**

After proving the concept with their own apartment, they:
1. Listed other apartments manually during conferences in different cities
2. Created a simple website to handle bookings
3. Photographed listings themselves to ensure quality
4. Only added features after seeing what users actually needed

When they pitched Y Combinator in 2009, they had real revenue and real users. Paul Graham invested $600,000, and Airbnb began its transformation into the platform we know today.

**The Lesson**

Airbnb's founders could have spent months building a two-sided marketplace with payment processing, review systems, and search algorithms. Instead, they spent a weekend creating a webpage and inflating air mattresses.

They didn't need technology to test their hypothesis. They needed guests. Once they proved people would sleep in a stranger's home, everything else was just execution.

**Key Takeaway**

Your MVP should test your riskiest assumption, not showcase your vision. Airbnb's riskiest assumption wasn't "can we build a booking platform?" It was "will people actually do this?"

They answered that question for $0 and a weekend of work.
