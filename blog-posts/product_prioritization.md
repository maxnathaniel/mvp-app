# How to Prioritize Product Features When Everything Feels Important

Every product manager faces the same problem: a backlog full of "critical" features and not enough time to build them all. Here's a practical framework for deciding what to build next.

## The RICE Framework: Your Decision-Making Tool

RICE scoring helps you prioritize objectively by evaluating four factors:

**Reach:** How many users will this impact in a given time period? Be specific: "500 users per month" not "lots of users."

**Impact:** How much will this move the needle for those users? Use a simple scale: 3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low.

**Confidence:** How sure are you about your Reach and Impact estimates? Use percentages: 100% = certain, 80% = high, 50% = medium, 20% = low.

**Effort:** How many person-weeks will this take? Include design, development, and testing time.

**Formula:** (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort = RICE Score

Higher scores = higher priority.

## Quick Wins vs Strategic Bets

Not everything needs RICE scoring. Separate your backlog into three buckets:

**Quick wins** (< 1 day of work): Just do these. Fixing that broken button or updating copy doesn't need analysis.

**Core features** (1 week to 1 month): This is where RICE helps. Score these systematically.

**Strategic bets** (> 1 month): These need different evaluation. Consider market positioning, competitive dynamics, and long-term vision alongside RICE scores.

## The "No" Test

Before adding anything to your roadmap, ask these questions:

1. What happens if we don't build this for six months?
2. Can we achieve the same outcome with a simpler solution?
3. Is this solving a real user problem or just something we think would be cool?
4. Will this feature still matter a year from now?

If you can't answer these confidently, don't build it yet.

## Managing Stakeholder Pressure

Executives, sales teams, and loud customers will all push for their features. Here's how to handle it:

**Make your criteria transparent.** When everyone knows you're using RICE, they can't argue you're playing favorites.

**Show the trade-offs.** "Building Feature X means delaying Feature Y by three weeks. Which is more important?"

**Demand data.** "How many customers asked for this?" and "What's the revenue impact?" separate real needs from opinions.

## The 70/20/10 Rule

Split your development capacity:

- 70% on core product improvements that serve your current users
- 20% on growth features that acquire new users
- 10% on experimental features that might unlock new opportunities

This prevents you from only iterating on existing features or only chasing shiny new ideas.

## Monthly Prioritization Rhythm

Don't reprioritize constantly. Set a monthly cadence:

**Week 1:** Collect feedback, update RICE scores, review metrics
**Week 2:** Draft next month's roadmap based on scores
**Week 3:** Validate with stakeholders and users
**Week 4:** Lock the roadmap for the following month

Between these cycles, only critical bugs or major opportunities can interrupt planned work.

## Know Your North Star

All prioritization frameworks fail without a clear metric you're optimizing for. Is it user retention? Revenue? Engagement time? Pick one primary metric and let it guide your decisions.

When two features have similar RICE scores, choose the one that moves your North Star metric more directly.

## The Bottom Line

Good prioritization isn't about building everything—it's about building the right things. Use frameworks like RICE to remove emotion from decisions, but don't let the numbers override common sense.

Your job is saying no to good ideas so you can say yes to great ones.
