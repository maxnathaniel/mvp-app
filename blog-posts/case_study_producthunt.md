# Case Study: Product Hunt Built in 20 Minutes

**The Problem**

Ryan Hoover wanted to create a community where people could discover and discuss new tech products. He'd been writing about startups and noticed there wasn't a good place for product makers to showcase their work and get feedback.

**The 20-Minute MVP**

In November 2013, Hoover didn't build an app. He used a tool called Linkydink—a simple link-sharing service where groups could share links via email.

Setup:
- Created a Linkydink group
- Invited his closest startup friends (about 70 people initially)
- Asked them to share interesting products they'd discovered
- Linkydink automatically emailed the daily collection to subscribers

Total time invested: 20 minutes.

**Why This Worked**

Hoover was testing one hypothesis: "Will people in the startup community share products and engage with this format?"

He didn't need to prove he could build a platform. He needed to prove people wanted it.

The Linkydink MVP told him:
- People enjoyed sharing product discoveries
- The email format worked
- There was genuine engagement around new products

Within two weeks, the email list had grown to 170 subscribers with overwhelmingly positive feedback.

**From Email to Platform**

After validating demand with the email list, Hoover built a simple website:
- Basic product listings by day
- Upvoting system (like Reddit/Hacker News)
- Comment threads
- Simple submission form

The first version launched eight days after the email experiment proved successful.

**The Growth**

Product Hunt grew organically through its community:
- Tech influencers shared their discoveries
- Product makers submitted their launches
- Early adopters became evangelists

Within three years:
- Over 100 million products discovered
- 50,000+ companies featured
- Millions of monthly users

In 2016, AngelList acquired Product Hunt for $20 million.

**The Content Marketing Angle**

Like Buffer, Product Hunt didn't just rely on product. Hoover was already building an audience through his blog before launching. He had:
- Written extensively about startups and product development
- Built relationships with key people in the startup community
- Created credibility as someone who understood the product discovery problem

When he launched Product Hunt, people already trusted him.

**The Lesson**

Building an MVP doesn't require code. Hoover used an existing tool to validate his idea in 20 minutes. Most founders would have spent weeks or months building a custom platform.

The email list validated:
1. People wanted this
2. The format worked
3. There was engagement

Only then did he invest time building an actual product.

**Key Takeaway**

Your MVP can be someone else's tool repurposed for your use case. Linkydink wasn't designed for product discovery, but it worked perfectly to test Hoover's hypothesis.

Don't build when you can borrow. Especially in the early days when you're just trying to prove demand.

Product Hunt's real MVP wasn't the platform—it was an email list cobbled together with existing tools in 20 minutes. That's enough to validate a $20 million idea.
