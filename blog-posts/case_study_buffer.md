# Case Study: Buffer Validated Their Idea in 7 Weeks

**The Problem**

Joel Gascoigne wanted to schedule social media posts in advance. Tools existed, but they were complicated. He thought there might be demand for something simpler.

**The Hypothesis**

Would people pay for a dead-simple social media scheduling tool?

**The MVP (Version 1)**

Gascoigne created a two-page website:
- Page 1: Explained the product concept
- Page 2: Showed pricing plans

There was no product. Just an explanation and a "pay now" button that led to an email signup form explaining the product wasn't ready yet.

This tested: "Do people understand the value proposition?"

**The Results**

People clicked through to the pricing page. That was enough signal to continue.

**The MVP (Version 2)**

Gascoigne added a third page: a signup form for early access. Now he could measure not just interest, but intent.

He drove traffic to the landing page through his blog and social media. People signed up. The signal got stronger.

**The MVP (Version 3)**

Seven weeks after starting, Gascoigne built the actual product:
- A simple web app
- A Chrome extension
- Support for Twitter only (no Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Basic scheduling functionality

That's it. One platform, one feature. He charged money from day one.

**Why This Approach Worked**

Buffer validated demand in stages:
1. Do people understand what this does? (landing page)
2. Are they interested enough to see pricing? (pricing page)
3. Will they give their email for early access? (signup form)
4. Will they pay money to use it? (actual product)

Each stage required minimal investment. Each stage reduced risk before moving forward.

**The Growth**

By starting simple and iterating based on real user feedback:
- Buffer added support for other platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Built team features for agencies and companies
- Created analytics and optimization tools
- Grew to serve millions of users

The company became profitable and known for its transparent company culture and remote work practices.

**The Lesson**

You don't need to build the product to test demand. A landing page with a clear value proposition can tell you if people care.

Buffer's first "MVP" was two web pages. No code, no features, nothing functional. Just a clear explanation and a way to measure interest.

This is sometimes called a "smoke test"—you create the appearance of a product to see if there's interest before building it.

**The Contrarian Move**

Most founders would have:
1. Built a full-featured scheduling tool
2. Supported all major platforms from day one
3. Added analytics, team features, and integrations
4. Then launched to crickets because nobody asked for it

Gascoigne did the opposite. He validated that people wanted it before he built anything substantial.

**Key Takeaway**

The fastest way to validate an idea is often to not build it at all. Create a landing page, explain the value, and see if people care.

If they do, build the minimum version that delivers value. If they don't, you saved yourself months of wasted development.

Buffer went from idea to paying customers in seven weeks because they didn't waste time building features nobody wanted.
