# Case Study: How Zappos Sold Shoes They Didn't Own

**The Problem**

In the late 1990s, Nick Swinmurn went to the mall looking for a specific pair of shoes. After visiting multiple stores without finding what he wanted, he thought: why isn't there a better way to do this online?

**The Risky Assumption**

At that time, people were buying books and electronics online, but not shoes. The conventional wisdom was that customers needed to try on shoes before buying. Would anyone actually purchase shoes online without trying them first?

**The MVP**

Swinmurn created a simple website and went to local shoe stores. He photographed their inventory, posted the photos on his site, and waited.

When someone ordered shoes:
1. He went back to the store
2. Bought the shoes at retail price
3. Shipped them to the customer

He lost money on every sale. The economics made no sense. But that wasn't the point.

**What He Learned**

People would buy shoes online. That was all he needed to know.

The MVP proved:
- Customers trusted online shoe purchases
- They valued selection and convenience over trying things on
- The business model could work (once he had inventory and wholesale pricing)

**The Genius Move**

Most entrepreneurs would have started by:
- Securing inventory
- Building an e-commerce platform
- Setting up warehousing and shipping
- Raising significant capital

Swinmurn tested the core assumption first. If people wouldn't buy shoes online, none of that other stuff mattered.

**How It Scaled**

After validating demand, Zappos:
- Secured wholesale relationships with shoe brands
- Built proper inventory systems
- Invested in customer service (which became their differentiator)
- Expanded beyond shoes

In 2009, Amazon acquired Zappos for $1.2 billion.

**The Lesson**

Your first version can be manually operated behind the scenes. Customers saw a working shoe store. Behind the scenes, it was just Nick running between his computer and the mall.

This "Wizard of Oz" approach let him test the market without the risk and cost of building real infrastructure.

**Key Takeaway**

It's okay to lose money on your MVP. You're not optimizing for profit—you're buying information.

Zappos' MVP was deliberately unsustainable. But it answered the million-dollar question: will people buy shoes online? Once he had that answer, building the real business was straightforward.

Don't build infrastructure to test a hypothesis. Test the hypothesis, then build infrastructure.
